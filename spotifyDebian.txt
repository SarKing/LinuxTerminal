After version 0.9.10, track change notifications were enabled by default. They can be quite intrusive. To disable them, add the following line to ~/.config/spotify/Users/<spotifylogin>-user/prefs

    ui.track_notifications_enabled=false
    It is also possible to launch spotify with the â€“ui.track_notifications_enabled=false option.
